# SFML-Snake-Game
Created in December of 2023

A version of the game Snake made using the C++ Simple Fast Media Library (SFML).

Snake is a game in which the player controls a snake that continuously moves around a tile-based board, trying to avoid hitting the walls or itself while eating the apples that appear randomly around the board. As the snake eats apples, it grows longer, making it more difficult for the snake not to hit itself.

In this version of Snake, there can be one or two players, player one using WASD and player two using the arrow keys. This version also has a sprint button, left shift for player one and right shift for player two, which doubles the speed of the snake until stamina runs out.

This game requires use of SFML, which can be downloaded here: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.6.1/
